<p>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday reinstated a Trump-era policy that requires asylum applicants to wait in Mexico while their claims are evaluated by U.S. authorities. The three liberal justices dissented.</p>
<p>President Biden canceled the Trump administration Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly called the Remain in Mexico policy, responding to criticism that it forced vulnerable migrants to wait out their cases in violent border cities. Lower courts found the administration failed to follow proper procedures in ending the policy and that the alternative of paroling into the U.S. asylum applicants en masse may violate federal law.</p>
<p>The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-block-reinstatement-of-remain-in-mexico-policy-11629496829?mod=article_inline">to let it cancel Remain in Mexico while it appealed</a>, but in a brief order Tuesday evening, the justices said the government was unlikely to prevail.</p>
<p>The administration “failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the memorandum rescinding the Migrant Protection Protocols was not arbitrary and capricious,” the unsigned order said. Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan indicated they would have granted the government’s application.</p>

<p>“The Department of Homeland Security respectfully disagrees with the district court’s decision and regrets that the Supreme Court declined to issue a stay,” the department said in a statement, adding that the administration was in discussions with Mexico over an agreement to re-implement the program.</p>
<p>A representative for the Mexican foreign ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, Remain in Mexico hasn’t been in use since 2019. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, U.S. officials under both the Trump and Biden administrations have been turning back migrants under public-health orders issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the request of two Republican-controlled states, Texas and Missouri, lower federal courts ordered the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate the Migrant Protection Protocols. In August, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, in Amarillo, Texas, issued a nationwide order requiring the government to reinstate Remain in Mexico.</p>
<p>Judge Kacsmaryk, a 2019 Trump appointee, found termination of the program to be arbitrary and capricious, and said the Department of Homeland Security hadn’t properly considered the benefits of denying entry to noncitizens claiming to be persecuted in their homelands.</p>
<p>Texas and Missouri argued that Remain in Mexico reduced burdens for their taxpayers, such as the cost of processing driver’s license applications for noncitizens who are allowed to move in while their asylum cases are pending. It can take months or years to resolve such claims before U.S. immigration courts.</p>
<p>After the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, declined to block Judge Kacsmaryk’s order, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p>
<p>The district court decision “imposes a severe and unwarranted burden on Executive authority over immigration policy and foreign affairs by ordering the government to precipitously re-implement a discretionary program that the Secretary [of Homeland Security] has determined was critically flawed,” the Justice Department filing said.</p>
<p>The administration said the order effectively required the Remain in Mexico policy to operate indefinitely, because it would terminate only when the government had capacity to detain all asylum applicants in the U.S. That is a practical impossibility, the government said, because Congress never has provided adequate funding for such a detention program.</p>
<p>Late Friday, Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees the Fifth Circuit that includes Texas, issued a temporary stay granting the government’s request through midnight Wednesday so that the full court could consider the matter.</p>
<p>In their response brief, Texas and Missouri argued that Remain in Mexico was a necessary response to a flood of migrants at the border, and noted that more than 80% of asylum claims ultimately were rejected.</p>
<p>“By eliminating the ‘free ticket into the United States,’ MPP served to discourage such futile and dangerous journeys [and] thus [is] an ‘indispensable tool in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border,’” the states said, citing previous court papers.</p>
<p>In a separate case, immigrant advocates had challenged Remain in Mexico, prevailing before a federal appeals court in San Francisco, which ordered a halt to the policy. Last year, at the Trump administration’s request, the Supreme Court reinstated the policy while the litigation proceeded, and scheduled arguments for March 2021. The justices canceled that hearing after the new administration dropped the policy and joined plaintiffs in seeking to end the case.</p>
<p>Federal courts stymied several Trump administration initiatives on similar grounds to Tuesday’s order, namely that agencies had acted in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which is intended to promote reasoned, transparent decision-making by the executive branch.</p>
<p>In June 2020, for instance, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-blocks-trump-cancellation-of-daca-immigration-program-11592489280?mod=article_inline">blocked Mr. Trump’s effort to cancel Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a>, an Obama-era program providing legal protections and work permits to unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by the court’s then-four member liberal wing, wrote that the Trump administration terminated the program without considering such matters as “what if anything to do about the hardship to DACA recipients.”</p>
<p>Tuesday’s order cited that opinion as authority for denying permission to cancel Remain in Mexico.</p>
